This project builds a smart bridge between AI agents and .NET microservices using Dapr service invocation and a lightweight MCP-style JSON-RPC Gateway, allowing services to automatically become AI-callable tools without any manual registration or gateway changes. Each microservice, such as MathService, exposes its normal business APIs (for example `/sum` and `/multiply`) and also exposes a special `/__tools` endpoint that dynamically describes the actions the service supports, including tool names, HTTP methods, descriptions, and expected inputs. These tool descriptions are generated directly from Minimal API endpoint metadata, keeping the service as the single source of truth and avoiding extra configuration files or boilerplate code. When an AI workflow requests the list of available tools, it calls the MCP Gateway’s `tools/list` method. The gateway then uses Dapr to invoke the `/__tools` endpoint of the running MathService and returns the discovered tools in an MCP-compatible format that the AI agent can reason over. When the AI decides to call a tool, it sends a `tools/call` request to the MCP Gateway, which forwards the request through Dapr to the appropriate MathService endpoint and returns the service’s response back to the AI. In simple terms, Dapr handles service discovery and invocation, each microservice self-describes its own capabilities, and the gateway acts purely as a translator between AI tool calls and HTTP APIs. Adding a new tool to MathService is intentionally minimal: the developer only needs to add a new business endpoint (for example `/squareroot`) with the appropriate metadata and restart the MathService and MCP Gateway. Once restarted, the gateway automatically discovers the updated tool list through Dapr, and the new tool becomes immediately available to the AI without any changes to gateway code or manual tool registration.
